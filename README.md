# mars-scrape

#By Julia Saavedra

In this project, I learned how to identify HTML elements on a webpage, including their id and class attributes, which are crucial for extracting specific information. Using this knowledge, I utilized automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup to effectively scrape data from the web. This included not just simple text but also more complex structures like HTML tables and recurring elements, such as multiple news articles on a single page.

Throughout this process, I reinforced core skills that are fundamental to data science: collecting data from various sources, organizing and storing this data efficiently, analyzing the collected data to derive meaningful insights, and finally, visually communicating these insights to others. This project provided a hands-on opportunity to apply these skills in a real-world context, enhancing my ability to manage and present data effectively.
